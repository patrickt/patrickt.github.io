                <section>
                    <p>I’m a senior engineer at <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>. I work on the Semantic Code team, where I play a part in maintaining the open-source project <a href="http://github.com/github/semantic"><code>semantic</code></a>, a toolkit for programming language analysis and interpretation.</p>
<p>I was born in Limerick, Ireland. My parents immigrated to the United States when I was very young. I’ve lived in seven different states, but New York City is my home. I’ve been programming since I was ten years old, and I’ve been a professional programmer since I was eighteen. (It’s the only job I’ve ever had.) I started my career at Apple, where I worked on macOS (10.5 through 10.7) and the iWork suite; I left in 2014 to work for a series of startups, where I started writing Haskell professionally.</p>
<p>I’m passionate about a great many things in life. Here is an inexhaustive list thereof:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Programming languages.</strong> Programming languages lie at the intersection between the binary, deterministic, silicon world of computers and the inexact, chaotic, organic world of human consciousness and communication. I believe that all programming languages, no matter how strange or quirky, are worthy expressions of human creativity and expression. I am driven to understand the history and historical impact of programming languages, the capabilities of the languages I use for work and play, and modern developments in programming language theory that will determine the course of future languages.</li>
<li><strong>Functional programming.</strong> FP is an inexact concept, one that means many things to many people. To me, functional programming is the practice of applying mathematical formalisms to real-world programming problems. My experience in industry has convinced me that a declarative, rather than imperative, approach to program design makes it easier to deliver reliable, predictable software artifacts to the world at large. I use the functional programming language <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language)">Haskell</a> to provide me with an elegant and powerful vocabulary for expression functional programs.</li>
<li><strong>Open source.</strong> I contribute to several open-source projects, the most notable of which are <a href="http://github.com/github/semantic"><code>semantic</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/fused-effects"><code>fused-effects</code></a>, an effect system for Haskell. I also work on <a href="https://github.com/patrickt">a bunch of other projects</a>. Though I don’t think that an open-source license makes a piece of software <em>a priori</em> good, I think that open-source can and should be used to marshal against the effects of capitalism. I care about the <a href="https://ethicalsource.dev">evolution of ethical software licenses</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Emacs</strong>. I think that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs">Emacs</a>, for all its flaws, is one of the great achievements in all software. I spend all day inside Emacs and have spent more than a decade fine-tuning <a href="https://github.com/patrickt/emacs">my setup</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Mental health advocacy.</strong> I live with type-1 bipolar disorder. Mine is well-managed, but I believe it’s a moral imperative to provide free, universally-accessible mental health (and physical health) treatment to everyone who needs it.</li>
<li><strong>Rap.</strong> I owe much of who I am to the visionaries and luminaries who’ve used their music to give me a window into their world.</li>
</ul>
